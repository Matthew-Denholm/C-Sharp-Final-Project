# C-Sharp-Final-Project
The goal of this project was to create a game using C# code. Any game could've been developed, but the project needed to be developed within two weeks time.
The game developed in this project was Reversi. Compatible with 2 players and 3 players. Could've been developed further to play against a computer, or for 4 Players to join. It also could've been developed to communicate across multiple computers should the class have gone that in depth, or more time was alotted.
