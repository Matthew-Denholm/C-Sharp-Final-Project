# C-Sharp-Final-Project
The following software was used and is recommended but may not necessarily be requried:
1. Microsoft Visual Studio 2017

Recommendations and improvements:
1. Adding A four player option to the game
2. Adding an option to play the computer
3. Adding interconnectivity between multiple computers (so 4 users don't have to take turns on a single computer)
4. A better user interface
5. A background movie to show the game in action.

This project was a great learning experience in that it gave a sense of how much time it takes to develop even a simple game. Teamwork, of course, is also always a good learning experience. The project reflected the coding lessons learned throughout the class, from the basics of intiailizing variables to nested loops and functions. The process of bug fixing was also a fun learning experience.
